**Project Proposal: InheritChain Protocol for Dora Grant DAO**
**Project Description:**
Unlocking the Future: Safeguarding Today's Digital Legacy with InheritChain Protocol
"Inheriting Tomorrow, Securing Today: Your Digital Legacy, Powered by InheritChain"
In today's digital era, the value of personal assets extends beyond the tangible, encompassing a realm of digital assets including coins, tokens, and NFTs. Surprisingly, a staggering $20 billion worth of these assets has been rendered inaccessible due to the loss of private keys or the unfortunate passing of individuals. In stark contrast to real-world assets like homes, jewelry, and stocks, which are seamlessly transferred to heirs, digital assets often meet an uncertain fate upon the loss of a private key. The question arises: Why not extend the same legacy principles to safeguarding valuable digital assets such as coins and tokens?
Introducing the transformative power of the **InheritChain Protocol** – an innovative solution with the potential to redefine digital legacies. This protocol is the cornerstone of securing digital assets for the future while honoring their importance in the present.

**InheritChain Protocol: Reinventing Legacy Preservation**

The InheritChain Protocol addresses the critical issue of digital asset loss through a secure Smart Contract framework. With the intuitive DApp interface, users can seamlessly authorize and sign their InheritChain requests. Automation is seamlessly orchestrated through the advanced capabilities of Chainlink, ensuring precise execution of user requests.

Through the InheritChain Protocol, users gain the ability to allocate their digital assets – spanning from wrapped coins to tokens – to their chosen beneficiary or heir's wallet. Remarkably, these assets remain under the control of the user, safeguarded and poised for a seamless transfer to the intended recipient as outlined by the user's directives. The brilliance lies in the simplicity: no sensitive private key is exposed. A straightforward approval and signature of the transaction request is all that is required, encompassing three essential components: Beneficiary Address, Asset Amount, and Time. This crucial information finds a secure repository within the intelligent contract of the InheritChain Protocol.

**Charting a New Era in Legacy Preservation**

The InheritChain Protocol is not just a concept but a groundbreaking innovation poised to revolutionize the concept of digital legacies. It empowers individuals to protect their digital wealth today while securing it for the generations to come.

As part of our commitment to Dora Grant DAO, we propose the integration of the InheritChain Protocol. This cutting-edge solution aligns seamlessly with the DAO's mission of fostering innovation and driving tangible impact. With InheritChain Protocol, Dora Grant DAO can embrace a future where digital assets are preserved, shared, and passed down in a manner that truly reflects their worth.

Join us in harnessing the power of InheritChain Protocol, transforming the digital legacy landscape, and embodying the essence of "Inheriting Tomorrow, Securing Today."

**What I Did for the Dora Grant DAO Round 4:**

As an active participant in Dora Grant DAO Round 4, I applied the transformative capabilities of the **InheritChain Protocol** to address critical challenges and contribute to the DAO's mission of fostering innovation and tangible impact.

**Problem:**
The problem at hand revolved around the vulnerability of digital legacies, with valuable assets like coins, tokens, and NFTs at risk of being lost due to private key misplacement or the unfortunate passing of their owners. This presented a significant challenge to the preservation of digital wealth and the seamless transfer of assets to intended beneficiaries.

**Solution:**
To address this challenge, I introduced the **InheritChain Protocol**, a groundbreaking solution designed to revolutionize digital legacy preservation. Through this protocol, users gain the power to secure their digital assets for the future while ensuring their accessibility and transferability to beneficiaries. The protocol achieves this by utilizing a secure Smart Contract framework, intuitive DApp interface, and the automation capabilities of Chainlink. Users can authorize and sign InheritChain requests, allowing their digital assets to be seamlessly transferred to chosen beneficiaries at specified times, all while safeguarding their private keys.

**Challenges:**
Implementing the **InheritChain Protocol** within the scope of Dora Grant DAO Round 4 wasn't without its challenges. One notable challenge was ensuring the seamless integration of the protocol with existing project components. This required meticulous attention to detail, an understanding of the protocol's architecture, and effective collaboration with team members. Additionally, managing the complexity of secure Smart Contracts and integrating Chainlink's automation capabilities posed technical challenges that demanded a deep understanding of blockchain technology and smart contract development.

By successfully implementing the **InheritChain Protocol** within Dora Grant DAO Round 4, I tackled these challenges head-on and contributed to the creation of a solution that addresses the problem of digital legacy vulnerability. This innovative approach aligns seamlessly with the DAO's objectives and furthers its mission of driving meaningful impact through technology-driven solutions.

**How it's Made:**

# Technologies Used 
1- JavaScript
2- Solidity
3- HTML
4- css

Certainly! Here's a breakdown of how you can utilize each of the mentioned tools within the **InheritChain** project:

**5. Push Protocol:**
Push Protocol is a communication protocol that can facilitate real-time notifications and data updates. In the context of InheritChain, Push Protocol can be employed to provide users with immediate notifications about critical events within the protocol. For instance:
- **Transaction Confirmation:** When a user approves a transaction through the DApp, Push Protocol can notify them once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain.
- **Beneficiary Transfer:** Notify beneficiaries when assets are successfully transferred to their address, ensuring transparency and peace of mind.
- **Time-Triggered Events:** Inform users when a specified time for transaction execution is reached, ensuring they are aware of key moments in the process.

**6. Valist:**
Valist offers a comprehensive set of tools for developing, deploying, and managing smart contracts. Within InheritChain, you can leverage Valist in the following ways:
- **Smart Contract Deployment:** Use Valist to deploy the InheritChain Protocol's secure Smart Contract, ensuring a seamless process.
- **Monitoring and Analytics:** Utilize Valist's monitoring tools to keep track of the performance and behavior of the smart contract in real time.
- **Security Audits:** Valist's security auditing features can help ensure that the smart contract's code is secure and robust, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.

**7. ENS (Ethereum Name Service):**
ENS provides human-readable names for Ethereum addresses and resources, enhancing the user experience. For InheritChain:
- **Beneficiary Addresses:** Implement ENS to allow users to associate human-readable names with beneficiary addresses, making the process of asset allocation more intuitive.
- **Transaction Requests:** ENS can be integrated to display beneficiary addresses and other key details in a user-friendly format when approving and signing transaction requests.

**8. Covalent:**
Covalent is a data provider that offers comprehensive blockchain data, which can be invaluable for enhancing the InheritChain Protocol:
- **Asset Tracking:** Utilize Covalent's data to track users' digital assets accurately, ensuring the assets' presence and quantity.
- **Historical Data:** Access historical blockchain data through Covalent to provide users with insights into the movement and performance of their assets over time.
- **Transaction Verification:** Leverage Covalent's data to verify the successful execution of transactions and to offer users transparency into their asset transfers.

By incorporating these tools into the InheritChain project, you can enhance user experience, ensure transparency, and streamline the secure transfer of digital assets, while benefiting from the capabilities that each tool brings to the table.



 **Run Time Error:** One of our challenges was dealing with run-time errors triggered by non-ERC20 token addresses within requests. This error caused disruptions in the request chain, resulting in transaction reversals and the failure of subsequent requests. The complexity arose from managing failed requests while allowing the rest of the transaction to proceed smoothly. Our solution stemmed from studying "How to Send Batch Transaction" video guides, which introduced an alternative approach to handling run-time errors in solidity known as "Low-Level Call." By implementing this strategy, we successfully circumvented run-time errors, ensuring uninterrupted transaction execution.

- **Deployment Error:** Another obstacle emerged during deployment, specifically a bundler issue linked to the conversion of `**` to `math.pow`. Unfortunately, this transformation did not support larger numbers, leading to compatibility issues. Addressing this challenge involved comprehensive troubleshooting and meticulous optimization efforts. Resolving this issue was a crucial milestone, guaranteeing the smooth deployment of our solution and its alignment with the designated environment.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
